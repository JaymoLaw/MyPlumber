<div style="margin: 30px 0;">
<p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> My Plumber, operating out of 14580 La Mesa Rd in Victorville, CA, is known locally but lacks an official website. Although the company holds high ratings on review platforms, concerns have surfaced around inconsistent availability, sudden quote changes, and lack of written documentation. Customers frequently mention Alex and AJ, who appear to lead field operations and scheduling.</p>
<p>Multiple reports cite situations where clients were quoted one rate but invoiced another&mdash;without written proof. &ldquo;AJ was super friendly and fast, but the final bill was $300 more than expected,&rdquo; said one homeowner. Others noted extended delays and rescheduling without notice. &ldquo;Alex came out, looked at the job, then I never heard back,&rdquo; claimed a local resident.</p>

<p>Despite a strong presence on Facebook and Instagram, the lack of a company website makes it difficult to verify credentials, policies, or licensing. There&rsquo;s also no central portal for disputes or guarantees. This can leave customers without recourse when workmanship is incomplete or unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Before working with any contractor, especially one without a domain or published TOS, always request written estimates and document every stage of communication. Reviews suggest Alex is highly knowledgeable, but scheduling bottlenecks and poor administrative support drag the experience down.</p>
<p>Local homeowners are urged to check the BBB page and contact references before hiring. A transparent, consistent plumber will offer a physical estimate, clear pricing, and show up on time. If you&rsquo;ve used My Plumber in Victorville, consider leaving a verified review to help the community.</p>
